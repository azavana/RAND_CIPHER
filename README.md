# RAND_CIPHER
RAND_CIPHER is a random encryption program; based on Blowfish (Symmetric key block Cipher), Spritz (variant of ARC4) and VMPC (Variably Modified Permutation Composition); and also three hash function SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. The program also goes with a salt function which adds extra bits at the end of the clear message, in order to reduce the risk of collision.

- If no argument is given after ./Main.exe, default argument is: "THIS IS A TEST".

# How its works ?
- 1) Salt the clear message with a pseudo random salt function
- 2) Choose randomly the digital signature
- 3) Choose randomly the encryption function
- 4) Output all
